Project for Advanced Business Decision Modeling (COMM 365)

# What Did I Learn? #
I learned the importance of developing efficient and effective code and after this project was inspired to study algorithms and data structures. In ABDM one of the main topics we learn is recursion to find an optimal path or route when making business decisions. This calculator was designed to help graduating university students decide their yearly saving and spending policy to reach their retirement goals. Unfortunately, we struggled with time constraints to find an efficient way to write an efficient to produce these results. 

Solution: I utilized the concept of loop unrolling to only revaluate spending policy every 5 years.
