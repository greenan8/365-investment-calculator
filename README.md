Project for Advanced Business Decision Modeling (COMM 365)

# What Did I Learn? #
I learned the importance of developing efficient and effective code and after this project was inspired to study algorithms and data structures. In ABDM one of the main topics we learn is recursion in order to find an optimal path or route when making business decisions. This calculator was designed to help graduating university studie decide their yearly saving and spending policy in order to reach their retirement goal. Unfortunatly, we struggled with time contrains to find an efficent way to write an efficient to produce these results. 

Solution: I utilized the concept of loop unrolling to only revaluate spending policy every 5 years.
